# Experiment 2
## Aim
To study and implement C++ program(Data types)
## Theory-
Understanding the size of various data types is crucial for memory management and optimization in programming. Different data types (e.g., int,short int,long int,float, double,long double,bool,char,auto,register) occupy different amounts of memory and checking of size of some data types given by user.
## Int data type:-
In programming, the int data type is used to represent integer values, which are whole numbers without a fractional part.
For example:
- In Python, the int type can represent arbitrarily large numbers, limited only by the amount of available memory, as Python automatically handles larger integers with its built-in int type.
The int type is fundamental in programming for performing arithmetic operations, loops, indexing arrays, and more.
