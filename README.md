# Experiment 2
## Aim
To study and implement C++ program(Data types)
## Theory-
Understanding the size of various data types is crucial for memory management and optimization in programming. Different data types (e.g., int,short int,long int,float, double,long double,bool,char,auto,register) occupy different amounts of memory and checking of size of some data types given by user.
